# TFF_image_Classification
Implementation of Tensorflow Federated to classify chest x-rays. DenseNet-121 is used as the model that is trained on local clients using local client data and the model updates are sent to the central server to update the global model. Tensorflow Federated is used to simulate the federated learning environment which is beneficial where data privacy is important.
